âœ… Fix: Use a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
To access a private repo from Jenkins or Git over HTTPS, you must use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of your password.

ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step: Set Up GitHub Access in Jenkins
1. Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)
Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens

Click "Generate new token"

Use these scopes:

âœ… repo (for full control of private repos)

âœ… workflow (optional, for actions)

Copy the token and save it safely (you wonâ€™t see it again).

2. Add the Token to Jenkins Credentials
In Jenkins, go to:
Manage Jenkins â†’ Credentials â†’ (global) â†’ Add Credentials

Select:

Kind: Username and Password

Username: Your GitHub username

Password: Your GitHub personal access token

ID (optional): github-pat (or something meaningful)

Description: e.g. "GitHub PAT for private repo"

3. Use the Credential in Your Jenkins Job
In your Jenkins project:

Go to Configure

Under Source Code Management â†’ Git

Set Repository URL:
