DevOps - Automate the repetative task, easy, time saving


Previously ,

Developers develope the code and push over to github,
Then, to deploy that code over the server then they follow the below steps- 
	
	- Pull code.
	- build it - (.WAR, .JAR  (Artifact))
	- Test 
	- Deploy over server.
	
	

** DevOps Engg. comes here,

DevOps Engg. will automate this steps using Jenkins tool.

- We crete a pipeline in that all these steps are written in a script format.


Pipeline - > CICD ( Continues Inegration, Continues Deployment)
				  ( Continues Inegration, Continues Delivery)
				  
				 
How Pipeline will work ?

-	When we push our code into main branch, then the Pipeline will trigger and,
	it will automatically deploy the code over the server.
	
	

* There are also other tools than Jenkins -
		
	- GitLab, Github_Action, cloud_pipeline, azure_pipeline.
